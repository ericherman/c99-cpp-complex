The listing does not carry a license, however the educational spirit of
the writing seems to suggest that it is intended for use by readers:

    This month's installment does something a little different.
    Rather than just discuss a new feature in C99 and occasionally
    compare it to C++, we are going to concentrate on the
    intersection between C99 and C++. We are going to discuss how
    to write programs that use complex arithmetic and compile
    equally well under either C++ or C99. The key to opening the
    large intersection between C and C++ complex is the small
    header file named math-complex.h (shown in Listing 1).

The file "math-complex.h" is the contents of the "Listing 1" link.
The file "test-program.cpp.c99" is the contents of the "Listing 2" link.
The file "test-program-results.txt" is the contents of the "Listing 3" link.
